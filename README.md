Solution
---------

This solution deploys an EKS cluster on AWS. On top of that kubernetes cluster the solution deploys and configure:

- `Nginx`: is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

- `CloudWatch agent`: is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources.

- `Fluent-bit agent`: is an open source and multi-platform Log Processor and Forwarder which allows you to collect data and logs from different sources, unify and send them to multiple destinations. It's fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes environments.

Requirements
------------

- Python
- Ansible
- Terraform
- AWS account

Tested versions: 
- Python 3.7.3
- ansible 2.9.10
- Terraform v0.14.7

How to use it
------------

(Theoretically) The repository is intended to run automatically either by gitlab-ci. As soon as a new commit is populated to the SCM the pipelines should start deploying the Development environment.

In case you want to run it manually:
1. Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/adrime92/halborn-assestment-solution.git
```
2. Install the packages mentioned in the requirement section.
3. Fill the variables in the ```test/group_vars/all/main.yml``` and ```test/group_vars/all/vault.yml```
4. (Optional) Encrypt your ansible vault: 
```console 
ansible-vault encrypt test/group_vars/all/vault.yml
```
5. Run the playbook: 
```console 
ansible-playbook test/test_installation.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Considerations
------------

During EKS deployment AWS manages the creation of a role which is attached to the EC2 instances that would act as workers. That role is missing one essential policy `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`. Without that policy the CloudWatch and Fluent-bit agents won't have permissions to interact with the CloudWatch Service, therefore no metric and log would be sent to AWS CloudWatch. That step has to be done manually once the whole solution is deployed.

Next steps
-----------
- Use secure protocol HTTPS for the nginx load balancer.
- Automatize the policy attachment to the EC2 Role.
- Implement unitary and integration tests.
